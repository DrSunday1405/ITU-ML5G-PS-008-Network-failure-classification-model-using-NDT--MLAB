This code is used for MLP-base feature selection in KDDI challenge. We mainly operate the code in Google colabortory. Therefore, the dataset and model import are all related to the google drive.

Given the randomness of neural network, the code might not produce the exact same result as that in the slides

Also, the code still need further refinement.
